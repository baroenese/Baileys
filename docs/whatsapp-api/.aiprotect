# AI Protection Rules - WhatsApp API Minimal Implementation
# Last Updated: December 28, 2025 (Final Lock)
# Status: LOCKED - Documentation cleaned, production ready

## CRITICAL PROTECTION RULES

1. NEVER delete files without explicit user confirmation
2. NEVER modify baileys-manager.ts without reviewing PROGRAM-LOCK.md first
3. NEVER add dependencies without checking if they're truly needed
4. NEVER remove error handling or try-catch blocks
5. ALWAYS run `pnpm typecheck` after any code changes
6. ALWAYS check PROGRAM-LOCK.md before making structural changes
7. ALWAYS document WHY a change is needed, not just WHAT changed

## PROTECTED FILES (Require Extra Caution)
- src/baileys-manager.ts (Core connection manager)
- src/config.ts (Configuration)
- src/index.ts (Entry point)
- src/session-store.ts (Auth state)
- package.json (Dependencies)

## SAFE MODIFICATION ZONES
- src/utils/*.ts (Can modify carefully)
- README.md (Can update documentation)
- logs/ (Can clean)
- auth_sessions/ (Can clean with user permission)

## VALIDATION REQUIRED BEFORE CHANGES
1. Check PROGRAM-LOCK.md for rules
2. Run typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
3. Verify file count: 8 TypeScript files
4. Verify dependency count: 5 production + 3 dev
5. Test connection after changes

## EMERGENCY STOP PHRASES
If user says any of these, STOP immediately:
- "restore program"
- "rollback changes"
- "undo everything"
- "program broken"
- "tidak jalan" (doesn't work)
- "error semua" (all errors)

## CHANGE APPROVAL PROTOCOL
Before making ANY changes:
1. Explain WHAT will change
2. Explain WHY it's needed
3. Explain RISK level (Low/Medium/High)
4. Wait for explicit user approval
5. Document changes in CHANGELOG
